    <h1>18th Annual International Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology<br>
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania<br>
April 2-5, 2014<p></h1>

<h1>Call for Papers is Closed</h1>
<p>
<B>Important notes:</b>
<p>

<li>All RECOMB submissions should be full manuscripts (up to the page limits in the guidelines below)
<li>Papers that authors wish to be considered by PLOS Computational Biology should be submitted to RECOMB only, indicating this wish in the appropriate check box during the submission process.  The authors should not submit to PLOS Computational Biology directly, rather these papers will be forwarded by RECOMB to the journal.
<p>
<!--<a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=recomb2014">Submit Papers Here</a><p>-->

The 18th International Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB 2014) will be held in Pittsburgh, PA on April 2-5, 2014. The RECOMB conference series was founded in 1997 to provide a scientific forum for advances in computational biology and applications in molecular biology and medicine. The conference aims at bridging the computational, mathematical, statistical, and biological sciences, and bringing together researchers, professionals, students and industrial practitioners from all over the world for interaction and exchange of new developments in all areas of bioinformatics and computational biology. The conference will feature keynote talks by leading scientists, presentations of peer-reviewed high-quality research papers, presentations of exciting research developments that were published within the past year and poster sessions on latest research progress. 
<p>Papers reporting on original research in all areas of computational molecular biology and bioinformatics are sought. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
<li>Molecular Sequence Analysis 
<li>Regulation and Epigenomics 
<li>Molecular Evolution 
<li>Gene Expression 
<li>Biological Networks 
<li>Sequencing and Genotyping Technologies 
<li>Metagenomics 
<li>Population and Statistical Genetics 
<li>Systems Biology 
<li>Computational Proteomics 
<li>Computational Structural Biology
<li>Bioimaging

<p> Submissions will be reviewed by the Program Committee, and selected papers will be accepted for presentation at the conference. Accepted manuscripts will be published as a proceedings volume in the <a href="http://www.springer.com/lncs">Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics (LNBI)</a> series by Springer-Verlag, which will be available at the conference. RECOMB 2014 is partnering with the Journal of Computational Biology (JCB). Accepted papers will be invited, but not required, to submit an edited journal version for a special issue of JCB. 
<p>
<i>Parallel Submission</i>: RECOMB 2014 has teamed up with PLoS Computational Biology to allow for reviewing a selected set of papers for the journal in parallel to their consideration by RECOMB. No other parallel submissions are allowed. Authors who wish their manuscript to be considered for publication in PLoS Computational Biology must clearly indicate this at the time of submission to RECOMB, and submit a complete manuscript for review. Manuscripts that are accepted to RECOMB will appear either as two-page abstracts or full papers in the LNBI proceedings depending on their review/acceptance status in PLoS Computational Biology. In detail, the papers will be processed as follows:
<p>
1. The PC chair will screen all such papers and select those that will be forwarded to PLoS Computational Biology. The choice is purely based on scope and quality. 
<p>
2. A Deputy Editor for the journal will screen the forwarded papers and decide which ones will be admitted to review. The decision is again based on scope and quality.
<p>
3. Those papers admitted to review will be handled by an appropriate Associate Editor of the journal. This editor will receive the names of the reviewers assigned to the paper by RECOMB and will be free to assign other reviewers to the paper.
<p>
4. The first round of review by the journal will be completed by the end of November. Revision requests will be sent to the authors whose papers passed the first review. Deadline for revision is December 30, 2013.
<p>
5. By the time that the final papers are due for RECOMB, the journal will have decided on acceptance of papers based on one revision. For those papers that are accepted to RECOMB and PLoS Computational Biology, a 2-page abstract will appear in the LNBI proceedings and the full paper will be published by the journal. For those papers that were accepted to RECOMB and require a second revision by the journal, the authors will have the choice of going with the conference or with the journal. In the first case, the journal drops its procedure and the full paper is published in the RECOMB proceedings. In the second case, only a 2-page abstract will be included in the RECOMB proceedings, and the journal procedure is continued. In the second case there is a risk of a rejection of the paper by the journal. 
<p>
Papers for which a 2-page abstract appears in the RECOMB proceedings will not be invited to submit a full version to JCB.

<h1>Key Dates</h1>

Submission opens:  	September 2, 2013 <br>
Submission deadline:	October 15, 2013 <br>
Acceptance notification:	December 9, 2013<br>
Final version due:	January 16, 2014<br>

<h1>Manuscript Preparation</h1>
A manuscript should start with a succinct statement of the problem, the results achieved, their significance, and a comparison with previous work. This material should be understandable to non-specialists. A technical exposition directed to the specialist should follow. The length, excluding bibliography, should not exceed 10 pages. The manuscript should be easy to read, using at least 11 point font size on U.S. standard 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper with no less than one inch margin all around. If the authors believe that more details are absolutely necessary to substantiate the claims of the paper, they may include a clearly marked appendix, which might be read at the discretion of the reviewers. An email address for the contact author should be included. Manuscripts that deviate significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. 
<p>
For submissions published in the RECOMB proceedings volume, detailed formatting instructions can be found <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0">here</a>. Papers that are submitted in parallel to PLoS Computational Biology should be structured according to the journal's guidelines and also follow the formatting instructions above with two exceptions: (i) no author summary is needed at the initial submission stage; and (ii) the total length of the paper including figures but excluding bibliography and supplementary material should not exceed 11 pages.

<h1>Paper Submission Procedures and Notification</h1>

Submission of papers to RECOMB 2014 will be through the EasyChair conference system, following <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=recomb2014">this link</a>. The submission system will be open starting <b>September 2nd, 2013</b> and ending <b>October 15th, 2013, 11:59:59pm (midnight) Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</b>. 	For full details, please see the submissions link at the conference website. Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by email on or before <b>December 9th, 2013</b>. We request that an author of each accepted paper provides LaTeX files or an MS Word file in the special format for /Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics/ by <b>January 16, 2014</b>. In addition, an author of each accepted paper is expected to attend the conference and present the paper.
