<h1>Travel</h1>

<h2>Passport & Visa</h2>
When registering for the conference, simply check the box asking if you need a visa letter.  Upon receiving your registration and payments, the meeting organizers will send you a visa letter that is a required document for your visa application. The <a href="http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/temp_1305.html">U.S. State Department </a>Web site includes visa information concerning temporary visitors to the U.S. that may be helpful to you.

<h2>Flights</h2>
The Pittsburgh International Airport is approximately 20 miles from the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh.  The cheapest and most efficient airport transportation is the Port Authority's 28X Airport Flyer.  The bus departs every 20 minutes from the airport and reaches Oakland in about 50 minutes.  The following companies also offer airport shuttle/limo services:<br>
<li>Harper's Transportation - 412.861.3150
<li>Amore Limousines - 412.678.3524
<li><a href="http://www.supershuttle.com/">Super Shuttle</a><p>
Additionally, there are always taxis available at the airport.

<h2>Climate and Clothing</h2>
Spring in Pittsburgh can be unpredictable, with high temperatures of up to 70F and lows as low as 35F.  Bring lightweight clothing such as long-sleeved shirts or T-shirts, plus one or two jackets and sweaters. April can be very rainy, and there is often a sharp difference in temperature between the day and the night.

<h2>Liability</h2>
The conference organizers cannot accept liability for personal accidents, loss of or damage to private property of participants, students and accompanying persons, either during, or directly arising from RECOMB2014. Participants should make their own arrangements with respect to health and travel insurance.
